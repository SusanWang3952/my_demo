One of the things happened in the past week:
I got both flu and covid vaccines on Thursday(Oct 5, 2023) at CVS in Beverley Hills.
I had reactions to those vaccines. 
I felt chill, then felt hot, back was really sour, and I couldn't go to class on Friday because I felt dizzy when I stood up.
It was not a good experience at all.  :(
